# Express.js Missing Response Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where a route handler fails to send a response to the client.  This can lead to hanging requests and unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to properly send a response using `res.send()`, `res.json()`, or a similar method.  This is crucial for all routes to function correctly.
